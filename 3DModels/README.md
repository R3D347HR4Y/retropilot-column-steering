The HTD 5M pulleys and adapters are designed to be bolted on a 00-04 Ford Focus/Fiesta steering column just before the rack.

You can modify the files to create versions that fit your own steering column (works best on keyholed or slotted columns)

I have also included an adapter to fit a Toyota Steering angle sensor (2080 variant) on this column, it is possible that this could break your sensor so don't try this if you don't know what you're doing!


Are also included a bracket in two parts to attach a Nema 23 Stepper (1.85Nm variant) to the column, here's the BOM:

There's all kinds of other files including adapters which you can figure out and modify on your own, be aware the belt tighteners use 2 624Z bearings and a 20mm M4 Bold with the head chopped off (and bearings glued on)
These files have not been tested, it is a very early work in progress, use at your own risk!!

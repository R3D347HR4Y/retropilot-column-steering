This folder contains all 3D models in Solidworks and 3D printable formats

The pulleys and adapters are designed to be bolted on a 2003 Ford Focus steering column with a layer of rubber as an interface material between the plastic and steel.
They are made to fit an HTD 5M belt.

You can modify the files to create versions that fit your own steering column (works even better on cars that have a keyholed or slotted column)

There are 2 varieties of the pulley:
Clip version:
	Hardware:
	6 5mm dia 45mm long steel rods as axial reinforcements
	2 steel brackets for tightening
	4 3mm dia 20mm long steel rods as alignement and reinforcements
	Rubber from a bike air chamber (cut to a rectangle the width of the pulley, 62mm in length)
	
	Print settings:
	Infill 70% or higher
	Material: ASA, PETG, ABS or PC
	Perimeters: 3
	Minimal to no print cooling
	Supports everywhere

Bolt version:
	Hardware:
	2 * 25mm M5 Machine screws
	2 * M5 Nuts
	Rubber from a bike air chamber (cut to a rectangle the width of the pulley, 62mm in length)
	
	Print settings:
	Infill 70% or higher
	Material: ASA, PETG, ABS or PC
	Perimeters: 3
	Minimal to no print cooling
	No supports

I have also included an adapter to fit a Toyota Steering angle sensor (2080 variant) on this Ford Focus, it is possible that this could break your sensor so don't atry this if you don't know what you're doing!

These files have not been tested, it is a work in progress, use at your own risk!!

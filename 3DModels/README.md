The HTD 5M pulleys and adapters are designed to be bolted on a 2003 Ford Focus steering column with a layer of rubber as an interface material between the plastic and steel.

You can modify the files to create versions that fit your own steering column (works best on keyholed or slotted columns)

I have also included an adapter to fit a Toyota Steering angle sensor (2080 variant) on this column, it is possible that this could break your sensor so don't try this if you don't know what you're doing!

These files have not been tested, it is a work in progress, use at your own risk!!
